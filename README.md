This is a beginner-friendly **AI-based movie recommendation system** built using Python and the MovieLens dataset. It suggests similar movies based on movie titles using **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**.
## Features
- Recommends movies based on title
- Simple TF-IDF content filtering
- Interactive input with Google Colab
## Dataset
Used the [MovieLens 100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)
## Run on Colab
You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab:

- Loads movie titles and ratings
- Converts titles to TF-IDF vectors
- Computes cosine similarity
- Returns top 5 similar movies
## Example
If you enter **"Star Wars (1977)"**, it recommends similar sci-fi or adventure films.
